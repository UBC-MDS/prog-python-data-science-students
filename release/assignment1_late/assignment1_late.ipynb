Such predictions (and knowing what drives these predictions) can help runners by suggesting changes they could make to modifiable factors, such as training, to help them improve race time. Unmodifiable factors that contribute to the prediction, such as age or sex, allow for fair comparisons to be made between different runners.\n",

    "- sex,\n",
    "- body mass index (BMI),\n",
    "- whether they are an edurance runner or speed demon,\n",

    "Let's now use this data to explore a question we might be interested in - is there a relationship between 10 km race time and body mass index (BMI) for men runners in this data set. This is an exploratory data analysis question because we stated we are looking for a relationship between measurements within the single data set we have and are not interested in yet interpreting beyond it. We can answer this question by visualizing the data as a scatter plot.\n",
